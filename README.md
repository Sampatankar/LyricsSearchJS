15/20: Fetch, Pagination &amp; Lyrics.ovh API - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app will find songs, artists and lyrics using the lyrics.ovh API from https://lyrics.ovh

The app will display a UI with a song/artist input. It will fetch songs/artists and render them in the DOM.  There will be adding of pagination and functionality to get lyrics and display them into the DOM.

This is the 15th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.

N.B. There is a problem with B.T.'s implementation of the lyrics.ovh API as at this date: 28th July 2020. This will need to be resolved to show a working demo either in React or vanilla JS.
